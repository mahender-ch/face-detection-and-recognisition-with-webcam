# face-detection-and-recognisition-with-webcam
this project will allow you to detect the face and also recognize the face base on the database. 
* first step is to create a databse i.e. to run the create_dabase.py file and pass the name of as command-line-argument
ex:- python create_database.py your_name.
---create atleast 2 databse.---
* next step is to train the system by running the train.py file i.e. it will create a trainer.yml file
* then run predict.py and have fun......
happy detecting :)
